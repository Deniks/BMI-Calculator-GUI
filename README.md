# BMI-Calculator-GUI
## :construction:	Still under developement.

What is it?
---
This is a BMI calculator console application. Throughout the project there are used OOP principles such as **encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism** and more. The goal of this project is to, of course, revise the C# at its core and train design thinking.
Basically project's code is borrowed from BMI-Calculator-CLI but now it is possible to interact with it in GUI thanks to WPF framework :rocket:. 

How to run it?
---
1. Clone and open the repository.
2.  Run Calculator.sln
3.  With the Visual Studio IDE run the project.
4.  Enjoy the application :tada:
